## Create a Vite React APP
- It helps the child component to access the data directly instead of getting it from different levels of component (props drilling). Hence, this helps in discarding the use of props drilling.
- This is associated with the React and doesn’t exist outside the react.

#### So, what is the alternatives of context API which also works outside the React for state management? 🤔
- 👉🏻 Redux: It helps in passing data in an organized way.
- 👉🏻 React-redux: To use redux inside react.
- 👉🏻 Redux-toolkit or RTK: A lighter version of Redux.
- 👉🏻 Zustand: It is also a library for state management.
